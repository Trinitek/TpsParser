# TpsParser

A library for parsing Clarion TopSpeed (TPS) files.

## Overview

This repository contains two projects.

**TpsParser** is a low-level TPS file reader. It is a C# rewrite of the Java library [tps-parse](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-dev/tps-parse). It is able to open and read both unencrypted and encrypted TPS files. It is not able to write to TPS files.

**TpsParser.Data** is a read-only ADO.NET adapter. It is designed for extract-transform-load scenarios where you need to read a folder full of TPS files and write them to another data store.

## ⚠️ Migrating from v5 to v6

Version 6 is a major rewrite over version 5 to dramatically reduce memory usage, improve read speed, and improve testability.

### Retargeted from `netstandard2.0` to `net9.0`

Thanks to our removal of the `netstandard2.0` target, we've taken advantage of newer BCL types like `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` and use them liberally throughout the object model.

### The deserializer has been removed.
Version 5 included a deserializer that could map a data record to a user-defined class. The `TpsParser` class, `Deserialize` methods, and attributes have been removed. The deserializer was complicated to maintain through the rewrite. It may return in a future version under a different NuGet package; kindly file an issue if you need this.

### Class names, namespaces, and interface hierarchies are simplified.

The namespace hierarchy has been flattened into the `TpsParser` namespace. Data type model classes are located in the `TpsParser.TypeModel` namespace. Unnecessary interfaces and abstract classes have been removed.

### The value type model has been reworked.

Type models have adopted a `Cla*` prefix instead of `Tps*`. Type models are designed to better reflect behaviors of their respective type from the Clarion language runtime.

### Addition of error handling and text encoding options.

The `TpsFile` class now has `ErrorHandlingOptions` and `EncodingOptions` to control how the parser behaves when decompressing pages and decoding text.

## ➡️ TpsParser: Basic Usage Guidelines

### Simple Table Objects

The `Table` class abstracts away the low-level file structures for easier manipulation.

```cs
using TpsParser;

using var fs = new FileStream("contacts.tps", FileMode.Open);
var tpsFile = new TpsFile(fs)

// Gets the first table in the file by default.
Table contactsTable = Table.MaterializeFromFile(tpsFile);

Row firstContactRow = contactsTable.Rows.First();

// Look up values by their column names.
IClaString firstName = (IClaString)firstContactRow.Values["FNAME"];
Console.WriteLine(firstName.ToString());

// MEMOs and BLOBs are in a separate dictionary.
if (firstContactRow.Memos.TryGetValue("NOTES", out IClaMemo? maybeNotes)
{
    Console.WriteLine(maybeNotes.ToString());
}
```

### Compound Data Structures

The parser can read GROUP and array structures. GROUPs can have nested GROUPs, arrayed fields, and arrays of GROUPs.

#### GROUP Structures

GROUP fields, modeled by the `ClaGroup` type, can contain one or more other value types, including other nested GROUPs.

```cs
ClaGroup address = (ClaGroup)firstContactRow.Values["ADDRESS"];

foreach (var value in address.GetValues())
{
    FieldDefinitionPointer field = value.Field;
    IClaObject value = value.Value;

    Console.WriteLine($"{field.Name} : {value.GetType().Name} : {value.ToString()}");
}

/*
 * Output:
 * -------
 * LINE1 : ClaString : Mulberry Lane
 * LINE2 : ClaString : Apt 2299
 * CITY : ClaString : Atlanta
 * STATE : ClaString : GA
 * POSTCODE : ClaString: 30303
 */
```

#### Array Structures

Array structures, modeled by the `ClaArray` type, are simply the same field type repeated _n_ number of times. All arrays are one-dimensioned.

```cs
ClaArray tagNumbers = (ClaArray)firstContactRow.Values["TAGS"];

Console.WriteLine($"TypeCode : {tagNumbers.TypeCode}");
Console.WriteLine($"Count : {tagNumbers.Count}");

for (int i = 0; i < tagNumbers.Count; i++)
{
    FieldEnumerationResult value = tagNumbers[i];

    FieldDefinitionPointer field = value.Field;
    ClaLong value = (ClaLong)value.Value;

    Console.WriteLine($"{i} : {value.ToString()}");
}

/*
 * Output:
 * -------
 * TypeCode : Long  <-- This is a Clarion LONG, equivalent to Int32
 * Count : 6
 * 0 : 36
 * 1 : 88
 * 2 : 294
 * 3 : 506
 * 4 : 311
 * 5 : 9286
 */
```

## ➡️ TpsParser.Data: Basic Usage Guidelines

Many Clarion apps you encounter will structure their database such that there are many TPS files with one table in each. TpsParser.Data is oriented around using the folder as the Data Source.

```cs
using TpsParser.Data;

var csBuilder = new TpsConnectionStringBuilder
{
    Folder = "c:/path/to/folder"
};

var conn = new TpsDbConnection(csBuilder.ConnectionString);

conn.Open();

// Opens "c:/path/to/folder/contacts.tps" to the default table "UNNAMED"
var command = new TpsDbCommand("SELECT * FROM contacts", conn);

var reader = command.ExecuteReader();
```

For files that contain more than one table, specify the table name in the SELECT statement using the `\!` separator as you would in the equivalent Clarion-language `FILE` declaration.

```cs
/*
 * FooContact   FILE,DRIVER('TOPSPEED'),NAME('Contacts\!Foo')
 */

command.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM contacts\!foo"
```

### Compound Data Structures

By default, the reader will return `ClaGroup` and `ClaArray` objects with their children as unconverted `IClaObject` values just as they are returned from the low-level parser. You can flatten these by setting the appropriate property on the connection string:

```cs
csBuilder.FlattenCompoundStructureResults = true;
```

Field names will then be flattened like so:

```
// Without flattening...

reader["A"]     --> string
reader["B"]     --> ClaArray of 4 ClaFString
reader["C"]     --> ClaGroup of (ClaLong, ClaDate)

// With flattening...

reader["A"]     --> string
reader["B[0]"]  --> string
reader["B[1]"]  --> string
reader["B[2]"]  --> string
reader["B[3]"]  --> string
reader["C.X"]   --> int
reader["C.Y"]   --> DateOnly
```
